title: "The Bible: It's All About Jesus"
subheadline: "It's time to learn the Bible for yourself"
teaser: "The Bible is not written just for theologians. Or to put it another way, it is written so simple folks like us can understand. Of course there are many obscure passages requiring knowledge of some historical context, but there are enough clear truth to be understood and live by to last a lifetime. I like to use the analogy of a plane which is defined by three points. Let's call this a plane of truth. There are way more than 3 points of truth to define God's plan of salvation. If we frequently check our understanding or interpretation against them, we can't go wrong."

<div class="small-12 columns" style="padding: 0px; border-bottom: none;">

<ul class="side-nav">
      <li><a href="/bible-topics/book-of-romans/"><h4><strong>Book of Romans</strong></h4>
      <p style="font-weight: normal;">A thorough study of the book of Romans from chapter 1 through 11. Chapters 12-16 are left to readers to study for themselves. Martin Luther's preface to Romans: <p class="blockquote">This letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel. ... To begin with, we have to become familiar with the vocabulary of the letter and know what St. Paul means by the words law, sin, grace, faith, justice, flesh, spirit, etc. Otherwise there is no use in reading it. ... You must not understand the word law here in human fashion, i.e., a regulation about what sort of works must be done or must not be done.</p>
      <p>These notes were written without any reference to Luther's commentary except for the preface quoted above. The Bible is used as its own commentary in the writing of these notes.</p>
      </p></a></li>
      <li><a href="/bible-topics/book-of-galatians/"><h4><strong>Book of Galatians</strong></h4><p style="font-weight: normal;">
      Martin Luther said, <em>"the little book of Galatians is my letter; I have betrothed myself to it; it is my wife."</em>. In the same manner with the writing of the study notes on Romans, these notes were written using nothing but the Bible itself to be its own commentary.

      Reflections on a few of Jesus' Parables which were often misinterpreted.
