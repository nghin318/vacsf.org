> “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
<sup>14</sup> These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation. <sup>15</sup> I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! <sup>16</sup> So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. <sup>17</sup> You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. <sup>18</sup> I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.
<sup>19</sup> Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent. <sup>20</sup> Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
<sup>21</sup> To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. <sup>22</sup> Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
(Rev 3:14-22)

The common interpretation is the sin of the church of Laodicea is their lack of zeal, or their not having a burning hot passion for God. But if hot means zeal, or passion, then what does cold mean that Jesus said he also accepts? It's interesting that we accept the "hot = zeal" interpretation without ever paying any thought to the meaning of cold, because if we think it through, hot cannot be zeal, or passion, or anything in that category, because cold is the complete opposite of what we're holding in high regard. So ... what does hot really mean? Or better yet, what concept is Jesus trying to convey while using the symbols of hot, cold, and lukewarm?

Let's take a look at some letters that Jesus wrote for other churches as they may shed some light on how we can understand the meaning of lukewarmness.

#### Letter to the church in Ephesus

After praising them for their hard work and perseverance (Rev 2:2), Jesus rebuked them that they had lost their first love, and they're actually down from where they first started. He reminded them to do the things they did at first. But what did they do when they were babe in Christ? What did you do when you were brand new Christians? At this humble beginning you didn't even know how to pray, you didn't even know that you should say "In Jesus' name. Amen!" at the end of every prayer, you hardly had memorized any Bible verses, you didn't even know that you ... should tithe 10 percent of your income, etc. So what did you do at first? Just hold the thought for now. So far it seems zeal is not what Jesus is looking for in the Ephesians church.

#### Letter to the church in Sardis

In the eyes of their peers they were known to be a church full of life and energy, but Jesus considered them "dead." Jesus asked them to remember what they first heard and hold on tight to it and repent (Rev 3:2). Here's another church that God told them their "zeal" didn't count, but in a different way he told them to go back to their first love, to go back and do what they did at first. Is this why Jesus said in Mark 10:15: "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." What "zeal" does a child possess? What "work" can they do to prove their worthiness?

#### Letters to the churches in Pergamum and Thyatira

The problem of this church may not be something we're familiar with, but it, too, may shed some light on the issue of "lukewarmness." Jesus offered himself as the one perfect sacrifice, one that ends all sacrifices, for all the sins of all of mankind, now and forevermore. This is the problem with Pergamum and Thyatira, some among the leadership introduced occult rituals into their worship; practices that either minimize or replace the finished work of Christ. I'm sure if you search the web for background on Balaam and the Nicolaitans you'd appreciate more the meaning of the letters to these churches.

Most believers of all religions, including Christianity, assume that God's main concern is with the sins in our lives; but this cannot be further from the truth, because if that is true, it would be much like he worries about pimples on a leper. Not at all; his real concern is man's sinful nature: who do you trust as your savior? Jesus or whatever, or whoever, else that you trust to make you right with God. Other gods? Your keeping of the religious laws? Your sacrifices? Your rituals? God is only jealous of any means you might choose to replace Jesus, the one and only remedy for our sinful condition. What if you straddle between trusting Jesus and other means of salvation? Wouldn't this be called adultery? Or servant of two masters? Or ultimately ... lukewarmness?

Might it be that the trouble with Ephesus and Sardis was the same thing? The false zeal had become their god? Because if not, Jesus would not have had called them to go back to their beginning when they trusted in no one else but him? If you connect the dots between all these churches: Ephesus, Sardis, Pergamum, and Thyatira—well actually you should connect the dots from the words of Jesus when he was still on earth to Revelation, you would see the real meaning of lukewarmness: it's the mixing of grace and works—works manifested itself in different forms. It's the focus on pimples but not leprosy. They must have myriad seminars and conferences to address the pimples of our lives and neglect the thing they did at first: the joy, the first love, that came from having their leprosy healed by the blood of the Lamb. So in time the pimples in their mind grow to the size of the giants that the ten spies spotted in the Promised Land. They lost sight of the milk and honey, their first love, the exceeding gladness that only Joshua and Caleb saw. The simple thing they, the Ephesians and the others (not sure about Laodiceans)  did at first was: they took Jesus at his word, that he died once for all their sins for all eternity. Do you remember the joy and gladness, and tears streaming down your face? You believed, and you were forgiven, and you loved him so.

#### Now what happened to your joy? (Galatians 4:15) Why did you stop believing?

It's the mixing of grace and religion, or works, that makes Jesus want to puke, and vomit. Here are some of the words Jesus used in verse 17 to describe the condition of this church (note that these were also words Jesus used exclusively toward the Pharisees):

- You're wretched — not washed, not sanctified, not justified. Description of those that haven't accepted the forgiveness through faith in Christ.
- You're poor — their father is not God who is the one who owns cattle on a thousand hills.
- You're pitiful — the scum of the earth, the lowliest of all.
- You're blind — can't see past the law, no grace within them.
- You're naked — don't have the covering of Jesus.

You can be almost certain that this Laodicea church though may appear to engage in lots of lively Christian-liked activities, but in reality they may not even be Christians, because if they are ... why does Jesus have to stand outside and knock on the door to come in, and used all these adjectives against them to hopefully wake them up to their true reality? Therefore hot, in this context, cannot mean zeal (how can you ask a non-Christian to be zealous for God?), but must mean trusting in no one else but Jesus as the way to God, cold must mean someone who is still far away from Christ, but to this person there is still hope, and lukewarm is someone who has tasted God's grace but returned to the law (Hebrews 10), or someone like the Laodiceans that do church things without Christ.

> <sup>38</sup> “But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.” <sup>39</sup> But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved. (Hebrews 10:38-39—shrink back = go back to the law)

The erroneous interpretation of the Laodicean's lukewarmness is harmful in the sense that instead of calling the Christians back to the summit of their first encounter with God, it drives a wedge between them and God, it puts them on a treadmill of performance which not only takes away their joy, it makes them lose their first love--the very place when they came to God empty handed but their hearts were full, and now this faulty understanding makes them doubt their salvation.

I also found this errorneous interpretation in the Matthew Henry's commentary on the same passage:

<p class="blockquote">The sin Christ charged this church (Laodicea) with, is, not the having left and forsaken the object of love, but having lost the <span class="text-highlight">fervent degree</span> of it that at first appeared. Christ is displeased with his people, when he sees them grow <span class="text-highlight">remiss</span> and <span class="text-highlight">cold</span> toward him. Surely this mention in Scripture, of Christians forsaking their first love, reproves those who speak of it with <span class="text-highlight">carelessness</span>, and thus try to excuse <span class="text-highlight">indifference</span> and <span class="text-highlight">sloth</span> in themselves and others; our Saviour considers this indifference as sinful. They must repent: they must be grieved and ashamed for their sinful declining, and humbly confess it in the sight of God. They must endeavour to recover their <span class="text-highlight">first zeal, tenderness, and seriousness</span>, and must pray as <span class="text-highlight">earnestly</span>, and watch as <span class="text-highlight">diligently</span>, as when they first set out in the ways of God.</p>

Notice the words that are underlined, these are very subjective terms, used by one Christian to judge another—is there a spiritual thermometer to measure someone's absolute spiritual temperature? Is there a fixed standard of reference so each person doesn't have to guess how hot he is, or whether he's hot enough? This is not to mention that Christ didn't mean "hot" to be the same thing as zeal.

A couple days ago I narrowly escaped getting a driving ticket; I was about to make a right turn, but my wife asked me to stop to yield to a pedestrian who just started to step down onto the pedestrian crosswalk. A driver behind me became impatient so he swerve around me to make the right turn behind the man who was still walking on the crosswalk. He got the $155 ticket. After this I did a little research to find out what the rules are, and I learned that a driver must wait the entire time the pedestrian is still on the crosswalk, no matter how wide the road is. At first I got a little indignant about this seemingly rigid rule, but then I thought again, this actually relieves me of the burden of having to guess when it is considered safe to drive across the crosswalk. There is no clear rule about hotness if zeal is part of its characteristic. This would make for a need to constantly guess about what God thinks of us, whether he would spit us out.

I don't think God uses fuzzy logic to determine our hotness. The Bible is so clear about this: the line between darkness and light, between being lost and being saved, between out of Christ and in Christ is simply belief or unbelief. If belief is good enough for Abraham, it's good enough for us. God has put the cookies at the bottom shelf where a child can reach.

So read commentaries, but thoroughly check them agaist Scriptures, lots of Scriptures, to make sure the line of reasoning is consistent with *all* foundational truths laid out in the Bible.
